# Operator notes

Observations from the human operator's side that the cycle agents cannot
reconstruct after the fact. Treat as evidence in retros.

## 2026-07-31 18:35Z — ai-leaderboard pair: resolution contradicted the source

Positions `7e753de88823` (Moonshot Yes @ 0.065) and `0bf9fe3785c6`
(Alibaba No @ 0.083) both lost: Moonshot market resolved No (closed, 0/1),
Alibaba market at 0.9995 pending close.

Operator verification timeline against the named resolution source
(lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text, which 301-redirects to arena.ai/leaderboard/text;
Text Arena Overall, adjustments shown as "None"):

- 2026-07-30 ~20:15Z (entry): kimi-k3-max rank 11 (1486±10), best Qwen =
  qwen3.7-max-preview rank 21 (1475±10). Full rank-8..25 table captured.
- 2026-07-31 11:50Z (4h before check time): unchanged (kimi 11, qwen 21).
- 2026-07-31 18:35Z (2.5h AFTER the 16:00Z check time and after Moonshot
  resolved No): STILL unchanged — kimi 11, qwen3.7-max-preview 21, and no
  new qwen model was added (full qwen list captured, best is rank 21).

Conclusion: the leaderboard fact the description points at did not move.
The resolution went the other way anyway. Candidate explanations, for the
deep retro to weigh:

1. Resolver used a different view than our reading of "style control off"
   (e.g. the style-control-ON default view, where press coverage placed
   Qwen 3.7 Max at #5 overall — i.e., OUR interpretation of the settings
   toggle may be inverted, or the resolver's was).
2. lmarena.ai may serve a different table than the arena.ai redirect target
   we sampled.
3. UMA-style resolution process settled on the 92¢ consensus reading and
   no one disputed — market-consensus-as-resolution-precedent risk.

Lesson candidate (deep retro to formalize): a resolution-source read is a
bet on HOW THE RESOLVER WILL READ IT, not on the underlying fact. When our
literal reading contradicts a 90¢+ market consensus, the consensus embeds
resolution-process knowledge (who proposes, which view they use, dispute
economics). The 6.5¢ price may have been an approximately correct price on
the resolution process even while being a wrong price on the leaderboard
fact. Proposed rules: (a) treat "my reading vs >0.90 consensus" as a red
flag requiring an explanation of what the crowd knows about the resolver,
not just the source; (b) cap total exposure on any single
resolution-interpretation thesis (this pair doubled it: -$10, the exact
correlated-exposure pattern from DEEP-2026-07-31 §d); (c) prefer
resolution-source plays where the criteria are mechanical (a number in an
official filing/API) over ones requiring a UI-settings interpretation.

## 2026-08-03 19:10Z — the "egress block" on odds sites is a misdiagnosis

Cycle logs from 2026-08-02/03 attribute repeated HTTP 403s from oddsportal,
forebet, oddspedia, bet-experts and betmines to "recurring egress block".
Operator tested the same URLs from a residential connection:

- www.forebet.com → **403 from a normal laptop too** (site-level bot block)
- www.oddsportal.com → 200 from residential IP only
- api.the-odds-api.com → 401 (reachable; needs an API key)

Conclusion: these are anti-bot / datacenter-IP blocks at the sites, not the
sandbox egress policy. An allowlist would not fix them, and no amount of
retrying will. Two consequences for strategy:

1. **Scraping consumer odds portals is not a viable benchmark channel from a
   cloud runner.** WebSearch results (which are fetched by Anthropic's
   infrastructure, not the sandbox) DO work and have produced usable
   multi-book consensus before — but only for well-covered events.
2. **Market selection is therefore part of the data problem.** The scan has
   been surfacing Icelandic, Argentine second-tier and lower-league fixtures
   because they clear the volume filter in a 48h window. Those are exactly the
   events with the thinnest public odds coverage, so research fails and the
   cycle no-bets. Prefer events with deep, searchable coverage (major European
   leagues, MLB/NBA/NFL/WNBA, large esports events, scheduled economic and
   corporate releases) even when the raw scan offers "cheaper" candidates.

Operator action pending: a the-odds-api.com key (free tier, ~500 req/month)
would give clean JSON lines for major leagues and remove the scraping
dependency entirely. Not yet provisioned — do not assume it exists.

## 2026-08-03 19:10Z — three positions stuck unresolved, capital and attention locked

`b21e42c123a1` and `d2dd24206542` (Iran pair) are now 4 days past their
2026-07-31T23:59Z end date with `closed: false` and no UMA resolution;
`84ec821167d5` (Spider-Man) marks at ~0.002 but also has not settled. The
open-position monitor is correctly flagging all three as adverse.

Nothing to do about resolution lag itself, but two behaviors are missing:
mark-to-market losses on stuck positions should be reported in the score view
rather than only in cycle logs, and a position that is N days past end date
without resolution should be escalated in the retro as a *process* datapoint
(which market types stall?) rather than silently re-flagged every hour.

## 2026-08-03 19:25Z — root cause of the no-bet drought: the scan could not see past today

Diagnosis correction (supersedes the market-selection note above, which was
right about symptoms but wrong about cause). `core/scan.py` pages the gamma
API in `endDate` order from now. The near-term Polymarket universe is
thousands of sub-daily markets deep (5-minute crypto candles, in-play
derivatives), so pagination exhausts the `--limit` long before reaching
tomorrow. Verified: `--hours 168 --min-volume-24h 0 --limit 2000` returned
1004 candidates, **all of them day-0**. The horizon flag was never the
binding constraint — the agent could not have found well-covered events no
matter how it tuned it, and every "no qualifying candidate" cycle log was
technically accurate but structurally misleading.

Operator patch (protected core, so agent-side rules unchanged): `scan.py`
gains `--min-total-volume`, passed server-side as gamma's `volume_num_min`.
With `--hours 168 --min-volume-24h 0 --min-total-volume 50000` the same scan
returns 32 candidates, 19 of them 1+ days out, including ATP/WTA main-draw
matches at $200k-460k liquidity, a Bank of Mexico rate decision, and
countable-metric markets. Note the interaction: a 24h-volume floor must NOT
be combined with a multi-day window (an event five days out has little volume
today), which is why the two flags move together.

Why this matters beyond the fix: for two days the agent reasoned impeccably
about a candidate pool that was an artifact of a tooling limit it could not
see and was forbidden to edit. Its retros correctly recorded "no qualifying
edge" and correctly declined to force bets; nothing in its own evidence could
have revealed the cause. Worth grading in the next deep retro as a lesson
about the limits of self-improvement inside a fixed harness — the agent can
optimize its judgment, but not its instruments.

## 2026-08-04 ~06:45Z — UMA look on the Iran pair (proposals item, now done)

Checked gamma for both markets directly:

- `b21e42c123a1` (Iran military action vs Gulf State): **resolved No overnight**
  via a normal UMA flow — `umaResolutionStatuses ["proposed"]`,
  `umaResolutionStatus resolved`, `umaEndDate 2026-08-04T06:02:33Z`, final
  prices Yes=0/No=1. resolve.py already settled it (-$5). Nothing pathological
  in the process; the delay matched the market description's own "3 full
  calendar days for conflicting reports" clause (Jul 31 end + 3 days → Aug 4).
- `d2dd24206542` (US x Iran ceasefire, holding No @ 0.92): **no UMA proposal
  has ever been submitted** — `umaResolutionStatuses []`, `closed false`,
  4+ days past end date, Yes trading ~0.515. Reading: the same 3-calendar-day
  clause ran out with reports still conflicting, and no proposer will stake a
  bond on a genuinely contested ~50/50 fact. The oscillating price is not a
  resolver leaning — it is the absence of any resolution attempt. Expect
  settlement only when facts converge or someone risks a proposal+dispute.

Process datapoint for retros: "by <date>?" geopolitical markets with
conflicting-reports clauses have an UNBOUNDED resolution tail — the end date
is when trading stops mattering, not when capital frees. Cost so far: $5 of
bankroll and a monitor line locked for 4+ days. Worth weighing as a liquidity
cost when sizing this market type; category unchanged otherwise.

## 2026-08-05 — reachable benchmark channels: the drought is a sensing problem

Context for the cycle agent and the deep retro. The placement drought
(0 bets in ~21 ticks) is benchmark reachability, not thresholds — and the
odds-API rejection stands (see proposals.md, re-open condition unchanged).
Meanwhile the settled evidence now points one direction: across 5 graded
decisions, mechanical/final facts are 2W-0L and interpretation-dependent
facts are 0W-3L. The channels below are all reachable from the datacenter
(no consumer odds portals, no keys) AND they feed exactly the fact-final
categories the evidence favors. Integrate them through what you own —
strategy/discovery.py queries and playbook research procedure; the deep
retro audits the integration like any other edit.

1. **Polymarket-internal cross-market consistency (no external source at
   all).** Related markets on one event must be jointly consistent:
   moneyline bounds the spread price, sibling outcomes must sum sanely,
   derivative legs imply each other. Every check is arithmetic on CLOB
   books you already fetch. One event with 2+ related markets becomes
   several candidates whose benchmark cannot 403. This feeds the
   cross-market edge class — currently your best-evidenced class.

2. **Cross-venue divergence via open APIs.** Kalshi publishes market data
   as clean JSON (econ, weather, news events that overlap Polymarket);
   Manifold and Metaculus have fully open APIs. A real-money venue
   disagreeing with Polymarket on the same event is a benchmark at least
   as good as a devigged bookmaker line, and these platforms want to be
   fetched. Caveats: check the contracts resolve on the same terms before
   treating a divergence as edge; Manifold is play-money — reference, not
   benchmark.

3. **Categories whose resolution source IS the research source.**
   Scheduled economic prints (central-bank and statistics-agency pages,
   FRED), countable metrics (chart positions, on-chain data via open
   APIs), and weather markets if scan surfaces them (official forecast
   JSON is free). Here your estimate comes from an official number, not a
   narrative read — the exact fact-finality profile of your two wins.

4. **discovery.py is only three generic queries.** Gamma supports tag_id;
   per-category tag queries would surface mid-liquidity markets in
   cheap-to-research categories that the volume-ordered queries bury
   under sports. The right floor is asymmetric: a $20k econ market with a
   free official benchmark is worth more research time than a $400k
   tennis match with no reachable status source. Encode that asymmetry in
   the queries.

One warning attached: the calibration z is -2.61 — estimates run
overconfident — so more candidates through an unchanged estimation pipe
just loses faster. The channels above are chosen so the estimate itself
comes from arithmetic or an official print rather than interpretation;
prefer them for that reason, not only for reachability. This note is a
mandate to sense, not a mandate to bet.

## 2026-08-05 10:53Z — egress allowlist updated; §2 reachability claim corrected

The 07:19Z cycle was right to flag it: the §2 note above asserted
Kalshi/Manifold/Metaculus are reachable, without testing from the runner.
Correction and fix, in two parts.

**Operator action taken:** the cloud environment's network allowlist
(the routine's environment, Network access → Custom) now includes:

    api.elections.kalshi.com
    api.manifold.markets
    www.metaculus.com
    fred.stlouisfed.org
    api.bls.gov
    www.bea.gov
    www.federalreserve.gov
    api.weather.gov

The prior mode was the default "Trusted" list (package registries, GitHub,
cloud SDKs) — so the 403s you saw on raw requests were most plausibly the
egress proxy, not the sites. The odds-API rejection (proposals.md
2026-08-04) is unchanged; nothing here needs a key.

**Laptop-side ground truth (residential IP, 2026-08-05 10:5xZ), so a
remaining failure can be classified correctly:**

- api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets → 200 (no auth)
- api.manifold.markets/v0/markets → 200
- fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=UNRATE → 200 (keyless CSV)
- api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/LNS14000000 → 200
- www.bea.gov, www.federalreserve.gov, api.weather.gov → 200
- www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/ → **403 even from residential, with a
  browser UA** — this one is site-side bot protection, NOT egress. Do not
  burn retries on it; treat Metaculus as unreachable unless a later test
  says otherwise.

**Asked of the next full cycle:** re-test the reachable-from-laptop
endpoints from the runner (one cheap GET each is enough) and log per-host
status in the cycle line. If a host now returns 200, the §2 cross-venue
channel is open for it — Kalshi is the one that matters (real-money venue,
econ/news overlap; Manifold stays reference-only per §2). If a host still
403s from the datacenter after this allowlist change, that is site-side
IP blocking — log it as such and keep the WebSearch-by-name fallback; no
further operator egress action will fix it.

## 2026-08-05 ~19:30Z — CPI brackets: the "contradictory sources" were three different series

The 13:45Z/10:26Z cycles skipped the July CPI markets because WebSearch
numbers (2.7-2.8%) didn't parse against brackets centered 3.3-3.5%. Operator
pulled the actual market descriptions from gamma. There is no contradiction —
Polymarket runs THREE separate CPI clusters on the same Aug 12 08:30 ET
release, each resolving on a DIFFERENT series, all to one decimal:

- **"Will annual inflation be X% in July?"** (event 703573): headline CPI-U,
  12-month change, **NOT seasonally adjusted** (BLS series CUUR0000SA0;
  FRED `CPIAUCNS`).
- **"Will monthly inflation increase/decrease by X% in July?"**: headline
  CPI-U, one-month change, **seasonally adjusted** (BLS `CUSR0000SA0`;
  FRED `CPIAUCSL`).
- **"Will Core CPI MoM be X% in July?"**: CPI-U ex food & energy, one-month
  change (FRED `CPILFESL`).

Resolution source for all three: the monthly BLS CPI news release
(bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm) — api.bls.gov and fred.stlouisfed.org
are both on the runner's allowlist as of the 10:53Z note, so pull the
series directly instead of searching for headline numbers. Any consensus
figure found via WebSearch is only usable after identifying WHICH of these
series it forecasts (press "CPI rose X%" is usually the SA MoM or the YoY;
core is quoted separately).

Mechanical structure worth noting for the cross-market class: with June
data published, 11 of the 12 months in the YoY comparison are already
known — the YoY brackets and the MoM cluster are two prices on
substantially the same single unknown (July's monthly change), linked by
a computable base effect and the seasonal factor. Whether the two clusters
are jointly consistent is arithmetic on data you can now fetch. Checking
that consistency is exactly the fact-final, no-narrative profile of the
settled wins; as always, this is a pointer to sense, not a mandate to bet.

## 2026-08-05 ~19:30Z — instrument change: scan window widened, event_id in scan output

Two operator edits to protected files, announced here so the change in
your inputs is visible rather than inferred (the 2026-08-03 lesson,
applied in reverse):

1. **CYCLE.md step 4 now runs `--hours 336 --limit 800`** (was 168/400).
   Two weeks of scheduled prints and fixtures are now in the window, and
   the higher paging cap keeps the endDate-ascending query from
   truncating in the deeper universe. Expect a larger candidate pool;
   your selection standards, not the pool size, still govern what gets
   researched. discovery.py's queries and their per-query floors are
   untouched and remain yours.

2. **scan.py output records now carry `event_id` and `event_slug`**
   (first entry of gamma's `events` array, null if absent). Sibling
   grouping for the cross-market checks no longer needs the extra
   per-candidate gamma round-trip in siblings.py — group scan output by
   `event_id` directly; keep siblings.py for fetching live sibling prices
   once a group looks interesting.

## 2026-08-05 ~19:45Z — architectural stance: this agent is not built for speed; info-race dropped from real classes

Operator decision, with the reasoning so retros can weigh it as evidence
rather than guess at it. `real.allowed_edge_classes` is now
`["cross-market"]` — info-race no longer qualifies for real twins.

The reasoning is architectural, not just the 0-win record: an
LLM-cycle agent's unit of action is a multi-minute research session. A
speed race against reprice bots on a public data drop is a race this
architecture cannot win at ANY wake-up cadence — arriving "less late"
still means entering after the reprice on an estimate formed before it.
What this architecture IS built for: research and analysis — arithmetic
the market hasn't done (cross-market consistency), official numbers the
market hasn't priced correctly (fact-final reads), interpretation work
where hours of persistence make timing irrelevant. The settled evidence
(mechanical facts 2W-0L, interpretation/speed-adjacent 0W-3L) agrees with
the architecture argument.

For the paper side, the class taxonomy stays yours: keep measuring
whatever you want, including info-race, if you think the evidence
justifies the research budget. But when weighing where to spend cycles,
weigh this: a thesis whose edge decays in minutes is a thesis this
system structurally cannot capture. "Being early on a fact" only fits
you when early means hours-to-days (the market hasn't NOTICED), not
seconds (the market hasn't REACTED yet).

## 2026-08-05 ~19:55Z — tag taxonomy exploration is yours now, not the operator's

The two tag verifications the operator did (Economy 100328, weather 1474)
existed because you didn't know the taxonomy was explorable — not because
you can't reach it. You can: `gamma-api.polymarket.com/tags` is open and
enumerable (paginated, limit/offset, thousands of tags — verified from
the laptop 2026-08-05; the vast majority are per-player/per-meme noise).
Everything needed to verify a tag ("does it surface live markets, what
volume range, do they resolve on an official number?") is one
`/markets?tag_id=X&closed=false` query you already know how to make.

So this moves inside your sensing mandate, on your pacing — roughly
weekly feels right, but that's yours to decide: enumerate or spot-check
tags, score candidates by live-market count and resolution mechanics
(official print / countable metric >> narrative), fold winners into
discovery.py, and re-check previously-empty tags (weather 1474) on the
same cadence. A tags.py under strategy/tools/ is the obvious shape if
you want one. The operator stays available for what you genuinely
cannot do: egress changes, protected-file edits, and ground-truthing
from a residential IP. Taxonomy archaeology no longer qualifies.

## 2026-08-05 ~20:30Z — mandate: market selection is a learned competency, and right now it is ungraded

Operator conviction, stated as direction: how well you perform is
heavily determined by WHICH markets you choose to work on — selection
and exploration, not just estimation. Your estimation is measured to
death (brier_delta by category and edge class, the z line). Your
selection is not measured at all: when a day goes 0-for-N, nothing
recorded can distinguish "the pool held no edge" from "the pool held
edge and research picked the wrong candidates" from "the queries built
the wrong pool". The 2026-08-03 pagination episode showed what an
unmeasured selection layer costs. Three asks, all inside what you own:

1. **Make the fit rubric explicit in the playbook.** You know your
   strengths as a trader by now; write them down as scoreable market
   properties and select against them. From the settled evidence the
   profile looks like: resolution is mechanical (official print,
   countable metric, arithmetic) rather than interpretive; the
   benchmark is reachable from your runner (open API, WebSearch-dense
   coverage, or Polymarket-internal arithmetic); the edge, if real,
   persists hours-to-days (you are built for research, not reaction);
   the resolution tail is bounded (the ceasefire position is 5+ days of
   locked capital and attention); and research cost is small relative
   to what the market can pay (the $20k-econ-vs-$400k-tennis asymmetry).
   Today's Blue Jays bet adds nuance worth encoding: WebSearch-dense
   sports ARE reachable — the property that matters is coverage
   density, not category.

2. **Instrument the funnel so selection can be graded.** Per full
   cycle, record (machine-readably — a JSON line in the cycle log or a
   strategy-owned file): pool size by property/category, how many
   candidates were researched, and a skip reason per researched
   candidate (no-edge / benchmark-unreachable / ambiguous-resolution /
   budget-exhausted / market-agrees). Deep retros should then grade
   selection the way they grade estimates: which properties actually
   produced settled edge per research-hour, and did the skip reasons
   hold up in hindsight (a "market-agrees" skip on a market that then
   moved 20 points was a selection error, not a non-event).

3. **Budget deliberate exploration.** Selection learnt only from your
   wins overfits to two categories. Spend a bounded slice of research
   budget — you pick the fraction — on candidates OUTSIDE the current
   fit profile, chosen to test a named hypothesis about a property
   ("weather resolves mechanically; is the coverage there?"), and
   record the result even when it is "category not viable". A ruled-out
   category with evidence is a selection asset; an unexplored one is a
   blind spot.

The point is not more selection rules — it is that selection improves
the same way estimation does: measured, graded in retros, and edited
with evidence. If instrumenting this properly needs something protected
(a ledger field for market properties, a score.py slice), propose it.

## 2026-08-08 — odds API provisioned (reachability re-open actioned)

The 2026-08-04 reachability rejection's re-open condition was met (see the
2026-08-08 proposals.md entry for the numbers), so the deal changes:
`core/odds.py` gives you bookmaker consensus (decimal, feed to your
devig.py) and event status for the major-league sports the-odds-api covers.
Ground rules:

1. **Budget is the constraint now, not reachability.** ~450 credits/month
   hard-capped in protected code ≈ 10-12/day. A full odds pull for one
   sport is 1 credit; scores are 1-2. Spend on candidates that already
   passed your funnel filters, not on discovery. The 10-minute cache makes
   within-cycle re-checks free — batch your research accordingly.
2. **min_edge_book_devig (0.07) finally gets real tests.** That was the
   point. Grade the floor with settled evidence before touching it.
3. **WebSearch multi-book consensus stays valid** where the API lacks a
   sport/market; the API is the benchmark of record where it has one —
   cite which one the rationale used.
4. Tennis has status coverage again via `scores` — the 2026-08-04
   "visible but untradeable" class is back in scope where the API lists
   the tour.

## 2026-08-09 — forecast ledger: every researched estimate now gets scored

New mechanism (operator commit, protected core): `core/forecast.py record`
writes stake-free forecasts to `journal/forecasts.jsonl`; resolve.py settles
them; score.py reports them in a `forecasts` section. CYCLE.md step 5b makes
it part of every FULL cycle. Why: your calibration was getting ~0-1 settled
feedback events per day because feedback required a bet that cleared an edge
floor AND settled — while you were researching 10-30 candidates/day to
concrete estimates and throwing the numbers away. Now every estimate is
scored brier_delta against the market. Ground rules:

1. **Coverage is mandatory and audited.** Every researched candidate with a
   concrete (market, outcome, probability) gets a forecast — especially the
   no-edge and market-agrees skips; that's where the calibration data is
   richest. Deep retros reconcile funnel researched entries against
   forecasts.jsonl: an estimate-bearing skip with no forecast row is a
   finding. Benchmark-unreachable skips must NOT invent an estimate.
2. **Honest-belief rule applies identically.** est_prob is your genuine
   probability, formed before anchoring on the price. Gaming is pointless by
   construction: the score is brier_*delta* vs the market, so padding with
   near-certainties on near-resolved markets scores ~0.
3. **Mid baseline, separate section.** Forecasts benchmark against the mid
   at record time (no fill occurs); bets benchmark against the ask they
   filled at. The two brier_deltas are NOT comparable — never merge them in
   a retro.
4. **Forecast before place.** A bet candidate's forecast (`--skip-reason
   bet`) is recorded before `ledger.py place`, committing the estimate
   before the fill attempt.
5. **What this buys you:** `by_skip_reason` will show whether your
   market-agrees skips actually hold up, whether your no-edge reads are
   calibrated, and whether bet candidates are better-estimated than skips —
   selection grading with n in the hundreds instead of n=19.

## 2026-08-09 — threshold sweep: your min_edge floors now get tested offline

score.py's forecasts section gains `threshold_sweep`: for each edge floor in
{0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.15}, the counterfactual P&L, ROI and
brier_delta of having flat-bet every settled forecast whose recorded edge
cleared that floor, filled at the recorded ask. This is how the 0.04 base
floor, the 0.07 book-devig floor, and the 0.10 outside-view boundary get
re-examined from now on: against every settled forecast at once, instead of
waiting for rare clearing bets. Reading rules:

1. **Edge here = est_prob − recorded ASK** (the bet fill convention), not
   the mid the forecast brier section uses. The sweep simulates bets.
2. **It's evidence about the researched stream, not the universe** —
   selection already happened at scan/select. A profitable sweep bucket
   means "the candidates you researched and priced at this edge were
   underpriced", nothing more.
3. **Mind small n, and correlation**: same-day rows move together; the
   standing ~15-per-slice rule applies before citing a bucket.
4. Deep retros: when a risk.json floor comes up for re-examination, cite
   the sweep bucket alongside settled-bet evidence. Only the forecasted
   outcome side is simulated; opposite-side counterfactuals are a v2
   question if the data argues for it.

## 2026-08-13 — the loop now reads CI

CI has been red since commit 0403080 (every push on 2026-08-12 from ~05:40Z):
the new `strategy/tools/tags.py` has an unused `import json` and the CI lint
(`ruff check --select E9,F core strategy`) flags it as F401. Nothing else is
failing.

Two operator changes so this class of problem reaches you instead of only us:

1. `core/ci.py` (protected, read-only) — reports the CI verdict for the last
   pushed commits as one JSON line. Your `Bash(python3 core/*)` allowance
   covers it. It degrades to `"status": "unknown"` if the API is unreachable
   from your environment; log that if you see it.
2. CYCLE.md step 0c — on a `"failure"` verdict, acting on it is part of the
   cycle: fix causes in your paths, file proposals for causes in ours.

The current red CI is yours to clear (one line in tags.py). Treat it as the
first live test of step 0c.

## 2026-08-13 — unshallow proposal actioned

The 2026-08-11 unshallow proposal (three dated instances) is actioned:
CYCLE.md step 0 and loop.sh now unshallow (`git fetch --unshallow`, falling
back to `--deepen=1000`) before any behind/diverged determination. The
deep-retro routine prompt gets the same guard operator-side. If a fourth
false-divergence appears despite this, that is a new fact — propose again.

## 2026-08-24 - detached-HEAD push guard actioned (2026-08-17 proposal)

Both halves of the proposal are in:

- `loop.sh` reattaches `main` to HEAD (`git checkout -B main HEAD`) at the
  top of every cycle, before any sync or push logic judges state.
- CYCLE.md step 9 now (a) reattaches before pushing, because scheduled
  cloud cycles bypass loop.sh entirely and that is where the trigger state
  keeps recurring, and (b) verifies the push took: after pushing,
  `git rev-parse HEAD` must equal `git rev-parse origin/main`, or the push
  is not done and must not be logged as done.

The playbook guard (98324bf) stays as defense in depth; if step 9's verify
ever fires for a reason other than detached HEAD, that is a new fact -
propose again.

## 2026-08-24 - inverted-outcome guard actioned (2026-08-16 proposal)

`forecast.py record` now refuses any row where |est_prob - mid| > 0.40
unless `--confirm-extreme` is passed. Genuine extreme disagreements (the
outside-view-veto class) cost you one flag at exactly the moment you
should be pausing; an outcome-side typo like fe954ed9f325 gets caught at
the only moment it is fixable. The optional `voided` status from the
proposal is not implemented - the guard prevents the next instance, and
fe954ed9f325's ~Aug 28 settlement still needs the manual exclusion your
watch item already carries.

## 2026-08-24 - forecast revision support actioned (2026-08-10 proposal)

`forecast.py record --supersede` replaces the live open forecast on a
market+outcome when the read has materially changed (|delta est_prob| >=
0.05, or a changed skip-reason). The rows are linked (`supersedes` /
`superseded_by`); the anti-flooding rejection still fires without the flag
or without a material change.

Design followed your 2026-08-11 note, not the proposal's literal
"excluded from settlement" wording: the superseded row STAYS OPEN and
still settles, but score.py grades it in a separate `revised_away` slice
instead of the headline stats and the threshold sweeps. Whether your
revisions improve estimates is now measured, not assumed - PLBY
2026-08-10 says don't assume. The stale funnel-note workaround can
retire: the open AfD Sachsen-Anhalt read (de95e5168de3's forecast row)
can now be superseded as the polls move.

## 2026-08-24 - No-side threshold-sweep slice actioned (2026-08-14 proposal)

`score.py` now reports `threshold_sweep_no` alongside `threshold_sweep`:
same edge grid, complement edge `best_bid_at_record - est_prob`, filled by
buying the other side at `1 - best_bid`; a row wins when the forecasted
outcome lost. Rows lacking `best_bid_at_record` are skipped and counted
(`threshold_sweep_no_skipped`). Your side splits are now machine-computed
and cannot go stale - the endorsement's instrument argument, after the
hand-arithmetic failures of Aug 18-19.

First run on the full journal agrees with the corrected Aug 19 picture:
the No-side stream is near flat (for example -0.05u at the 0.10 floor,
n=11) against a clearly negative Yes-side stream. Note the sweep grades
ALL settled forecasts at recorded prices; it is not the same population
as the hand-kept realizable veto-ledger table, so the numbers will not
match that table row for row.

## 2026-08-24 ~20:30Z - screening tier and event triggers installed (operator)

Two new protected instruments landed tonight. Both widen your sensing; neither
changes a single trading rule.

**1. Screening tier (`core/screen.py`).** Step 4 of CYCLE.md is now
"Scan & screen": scan's output pipes through a cheap model that scores every
candidate for price-vs-estimate divergence and hands you a ranked top-15 on
stdout. Evidence for the design: your own funnel researches ~3 of ~1,000
scanned markets per cycle, and the 2026 literature is unambiguous that
coverage, not per-market depth, is where trading agents win. Rules of the
road:

- The screener ranks, it does not gate. Watch items, mechanical-econ and the
  sibling census keep their slots.
- Screener probabilities are triage guesses. They never enter
  `journal/forecasts.jsonl` and you must not cite them as evidence of anything
  except "worth research time". `core/screen.py` refuses to write there by
  design.
- `strategy/screener-prompt.md` is yours - same evidence rules as the
  playbook. `journal/screener.jsonl` accumulates the record to grade it
  against: once escalated markets settle, escalation quality (did high
  divergence predict researchable edge?) is a gradeable question. Treat it
  like any other instrument audit.
- Funnel lines now carry `screened`, `escalated`, `screener_spend` -
  mandatory, same weld logic as `pool_total`.
- Budget: $5/UTC day, spend public in `journal/screener-quota.json`. If the
  budget or the key is missing the cycle proceeds unscreened; say so in the
  funnel line, do not work around.

**2. Event triggers (`core/watch.py` + `strategy/watchlist.json`).** A second
cloud routine runs `core/watch.py check` every ~15 minutes and starts a
TRIGGERED cycle (new tick type, see CYCLE.md) when a watched price moves, a
liquid market appears, or a calendar window you set opens. What this buys you:
research lands minutes after a catalyst instead of at the next hourly tick.

**Asked of the next full cycle:** seed `strategy/watchlist.json` from your
open AfD position (a token_id and a threshold you would actually want to be
woken for) and from any schedule.json watch item with a known release time
(PCE Aug 26, BoK Aug 27, Canada GDP + UMich Aug 28 are obvious calendar
entries). Prune expired entries when the verdict lists them. The watchlist is
yours; the caps are not.

## 2026-08-24 ~23:15Z - screener switched to subagent fan-out; no API key, ever (operator)

Correction to the 20:30Z section before you act on it. The screening tier
shipped tonight was rebuilt before its first live run. The direct-API path
is gone: the operator will not spend outside the Claude subscription, so
`core/screen.py` no longer calls any API and no key will ever be
provisioned. What replaced it:

- Step 4 is now `scan | screen.py prepare`, then YOU fan out one Haiku
  Task subagent per batch file (the exact prompt is in prepare's stdout
  header), then `screen.py collect`. CYCLE.md has the details; your cloud
  session now has the Task tool.
- The pool is stratified before screening: markets closing inside 48h, top
  liquidity, top 24h volume, and a random tail sample. The random lane is
  the audit lane - it exists so the screen can learn that its own selection
  is wrong, and its floor (20) is code-enforced. `strategy/screener-strata.json`
  is yours to tune inside the code bounds; prepare's `dropped_by_reason`
  tells you what the strata cut, and that count belongs in your funnel line.
- The funnel field is `screener_batches` (this supersedes `screener_spend`
  from the 20:30Z section - that field never shipped). Quota is counted in
  batches per UTC day (150 cap) in `journal/screener-quota.json`.
- Screener rows still never touch `journal/forecasts.jsonl`, and screener
  probabilities are still not evidence of anything except research
  priority.

The 20:30Z section's watchlist ask stands unchanged: seed
`strategy/watchlist.json` from your open position and the PCE/BoK/GDP
calendar this week.

## 2026-08-25 ~06:35Z - screener collect now unwraps the {batch_id, scores} wrapper (operator)

The endorsed cheapest fix from the 04:16Z proposal is shipped:
`screen.py collect` (`parse_answers`) now unwraps the one observed
malformed shape - a subagent writing `{"batch_id": ..., "scores": [...]}`
instead of the bare array - and grades the inner rows normally. A real
answer object carries `market_id` and a wrapper never does, so the unwrap
cannot swallow a legitimate single-answer file. Anything else malformed
still fails exactly as before; nothing new enters the pool unvalidated.

What this changes for you: nothing in procedure. Keep reporting
collected/expected in every funnel line - that number is still the only
measure of whether this fix closed the failure class or the subagents
find a new shape. If a new wrapper variant shows up, escalate it the
same way; do not widen your own parsing.

## 2026-08-25 ~07:30Z - blending and calibration measured against your forecasts; both refused for now (operator)

The 2026-08-24 edge-research plan ranked market-prior blending (replace the
outside-view veto with 0.7*mid + 0.3*est, trade the residual) and Platt
calibration as the next strategy changes. Before shipping either, both were
tested offline against your 254 settled live forecasts. Both fail on
today's data, so neither ships. What was found:

- **Blending adds nothing.** The new `blend_sweep` slice in score.py (run
  it - it prints below the sweeps) computes the Brier of w*mid + (1-w)*est
  for a weight grid plus the closed-form optimal weight. Overall: w_opt
  0.928, improvement over the market 0.0000 at n=254. On the 42
  disagreement rows (|est-mid| >= 0.05, the only rows a blend policy would
  act on): w_opt 1.111 - past the market, meaning your estimate carried
  negative marginal information exactly where blending would trade. A
  0.7/0.3 blend would have scored +0.0034 WORSE than the market there.
  This agrees with your counterfactual veto ledger (25 blocked trades, net
  -9.42u avoided): the veto stays. Blending is adopted only if w_opt drops
  materially below 1.0 on a disagreement slice you can trust (think
  n >= 100 and w_opt <= 0.9); the slice keeps that question measured every
  cycle, and grading it is now part of reading score.py.
- **There is nothing to calibrate.** Platt scaling fit on a 70/30
  chronological split came back as the identity transform (a=-0.08,
  b=1.06) and slightly worsened test Brier. Your broad forecast stream is
  already calibrated; the z=-3.08 overconfidence lives in the 21-bet
  selection tail, which is too small to fit anything on. calibrate.py is
  not built. Re-raise if the calibration buckets in score.py ever show a
  systematic slope at real n.
- **Ensembling on escalated candidates is deferred with the same logic:**
  it sharpens estimates, and today's evidence says sharper versions of
  your estimates still add no information at the market's margin. Coverage
  (screener + triggers) stays the live thesis.
- Housekeeping: the plan's CLOB-rotation worry is closed - core/pmapi.py
  and strategy/tools/quote.py are raw REST against gamma and
  clob.polymarket.com (no archived-SDK dependency); both endpoints
  live-verified today.

Nothing changes in your procedure. The veto, the counterfactual ledger,
and the funnel discipline all stand as they are.

## 2026-08-31 ~21:30Z - .gitignore ask actioned; use work/ for cycle scratch (operator)

The 2026-08-28 .gitignore ask is done. The named scratch files
(`scan-stderr.txt`, `scan.stderr`, `screen-prepare.json`,
`screen_prepare.json`, `screen.stderr`, `subagent-template.txt`) are now
ignored, and so is a new `work/` directory at the repo root.

Going forward, write per-run working files under `work/` instead of the
repo root. The specific filenames above stay ignored as a safety net, but
`work/` is the convention: anything under it never reaches git. Point the
cycle procedure at it when you next touch the relevant steps - no
separate ask needed for that edit since the procedure files are yours.

This closes the only open operator ask in proposals.md. Mark it actioned
on your next deep-retro status pass.

## 2026-09-02 ~08:30Z - gnhf run 1: replay evaluator, in-sample policy v3, forward test pre-registered (operator)

An overnight gnhf run (6 iterations, 3 kept) built `core/replay.py`, a
walk-forward replay of a betting policy over the frozen forecast ledger,
and `strategy/policy.py` v3: both sides, edge 0.02-0.07, price 0.10-0.90
with a 0.20-0.45 dead zone, spread <= 0.03, flat $5. Its replay score
(+0.743 cw_return, 19 bets) is IN-SAMPLE: the thresholds were chosen with
all 420 settled rows visible. Nothing in your procedure changes; policy.py
is not read by the cycle.

The one finding worth your attention is the longshot bias in your own
beliefs: on replay, tokens you would buy under 0.10 went 0 for 16, and
the 0.20-0.45 price band wins 18% against a mean belief of 0.39. That is
the same signal as the 0.1-0.5 calibration buckets in score.py.

Forward test, pre-registered now so the verdict is mechanical:

- Universe: every forecast settled after 2026-09-02T00:14:36Z, scored by
  `python3 core/replay.py --after 2026-09-02T00:14:36Z`.
- v3's decisions on the rows open at the cutoff: a3ab895344cf no,
  d48834ed8f41 no, e9f9221a3afb yes, 650a1bcef8e7 no, 0b03a937a48d yes.
- Criteria: at least 15 forward bets, forward cw_return above zero, no
  single bet above half of a positive pnl. Fewer than 15 bets is
  inconclusive and waits, up to 300 settled rows.
- Trigger: `.github/workflows/forward-test.yml` checks daily and opens one
  GitHub issue labelled `forward-test` when the criteria can be judged.

If it passes, the deep retro will be asked whether to adopt the dead zone
into risk.json. The both-sides small-edge rule adds bets and needs a
second forward window before anyone proposes it. If it fails, nothing in
strategy/ changes. Do not edit policy.py in the meantime; it is the object
under test.

## 2026-09-03 ~00:20Z - blend re-open condition reset: new bar is w_opt <= 0.80 sustained at n >= 150 (operator)

The 2026-08-25 blend re-open condition (n >= 100 and w_opt <= 0.9 on the
disagreement slice) is closed as resolved-negative. The 2026-09-02
deep-retro pass had it right: it fired on the letter at n=111 / w_opt
0.892, the improvement at w_opt was -0.0005 brier, and the trajectory
(0.622 at n=70, 0.70 at n=90, 0.892 at n=111, 0.915 at n=114 tonight)
converges toward the market as the sample fills in. That is a
small-sample artifact, not an edge. Nothing ships.

The replacement bar, as you suggested, is:

- `blend[disagreement]` w_opt <= 0.80 at n >= 150, and
- "sustained" means it holds on two consecutive deep-retro status passes,
  both at n >= 150, with the improvement at w_opt at least 0.002 brier
  better than the market (a gain that could plausibly survive fill costs).

Only when all of that holds, file it as an operator ask. Until then keep
the one-line tracking entry in each deep-retro status pass exactly as you
do now (n, w_opt, delta). Do not build calibrate.py or a blend rule in
the meantime; the veto and the counterfactual ledger stand as they are.

Mark the 2026-08-25 condition resolved-negative in proposals.md on your
next deep-retro status pass. Nothing in your procedure changes.

## 2026-09-04 ~00:00Z - gnhf run 2: screener evaluator landed; the screen reads nothing over the price (operator)

An overnight gnhf run (10 iterations, all kept, squashed into one
operator commit) built `core/screen_replay.py`, an offline evaluator for
the screening tier, and filled two caches under journal/:
`screener-outcomes.jsonl` (8,677 markets, 8,014 resolved) and
`screener-events.jsonl` (market to gamma event, for clustering).
`python3 core/screen_replay.py score` prints the report in about a
second. Nothing in your procedure changes.

What the report says, at full coverage (18,047 screener rows, 3,110
independent events):

- The screen adds no information over the mid it is handed, on any of
  the four prompt revisions. The blend weight on the market is 1.11
  +/- 0.23 overall, and no fixed blend at any weight beats the mids.
- The original brief (f055b035, Aug 24) is at par with the market
  (excess -0.0007, z -0.7). The two briefs you wrote in deep retros
  (ce4bfcd2 on Aug 31, f7ddad12 on Sep 1, the live one) are
  directionally worse (excess +0.0033 each, z +2.9 and +2.1).
- Ranking a batch by divergence does pick more surprising markets than a
  random pick, but only because divergence prefers prices near 0.5, and
  prices near 0.5 are surprising however they resolve. Against that null
  the screen's own contribution is zero on every revision. Your cycle
  reasons have been saying the same thing from the other side ("lazy
  0.5/0.5 spread rows again, not signal").
- Earlier readings of this data that you may have seen quoted are
  withdrawn: "the screen loses worst when it disagrees loudly" is the
  grouping variable squared, and "high confidence is the worst bucket"
  is noise at n=172.

What this means for you:

- Do not edit `strategy/screener-prompt.md`. Two edits have made it
  worse and the evaluator bounds any prompt signal at under about 0.002
  Brier, so there is no room for a third to pay off. Leave it as the
  object under measurement until this note is superseded.
- Keep treating the escalation list as "the markets priced nearest
  50/50", which is what it is. Do not read divergence as a belief.
- The operator will test a no-model ranking (mids nearest 0.5) against
  the same surprise metric offline. If it matches, the Haiku batches in
  screen.py get replaced by the formula, which also frees the screener
  quota. You will hear about that here before anything changes.
- A nightly bounded `outcomes` re-check will be added to keep the cache
  current; do not run it yourself.

Deep retro: add a one-line tracking entry for this on each status pass
(rows scored, live prompt_rev excess and z), the way you track the blend
condition. No proposal is open on it.

## 2026-09-04 ~06:20Z - histories reconciled; d9158ee boundary ask closed; gnhf run 3 verdict (operator)

Both open operator asks from the 2026-09-04 deep-retro pass are handled.

The divergence is merged. Local main and origin/main are one history
again as of this note's commit. Both sides' journal rows are kept: the
five operator-machine forecast rows, both runners' screener batches,
both MTM checkpoint chains in schedule.json, and both proposals
sections. screener-quota.json now reads the sum of both runners
(60 batches / 1200 markets for the day). Nothing was re-settled by
hand; resolve.py runs as normal next cycle.

d9158ee is blessed as-is. core/screen_rank.py,
journal/screener-rank-decision.md and strategy/screener-filters.json are
operator work from gnhf run 3 that the 00:26Z cycle's `git add -A` swept
into a cycle commit. History stays; CI on later pushes is green because
the guard checks each pushed range. The root cause was the operator
running gnhf in the live checkout while loop.sh was up. Future runs use
a separate worktree. Mark the d9158ee ask actioned on your next
deep-retro status pass. The collision-guard mechanism ask stays open.

gnhf run 3's verdict, for the record: keep the Haiku tier, take only the
deterministic filters as a pre-filter. The formula's own list is the
argument against it (13 to 14 of 15 escalations are sports and esports
coin flips priced 0.475 to 0.525). The lazy 0.50/0.50 answer is the
tier's worst habit and the title-regex filter removes three quarters of
it. The operator will wire the filters into screen.py prepare; nothing
in your procedure changes and screener-prompt.md stays frozen. Do not
run core/screen_rank.py; it is dormant.

## 2026-09-04 ~07:20Z - screener pre-filter live, quota split per runner, union merge for append-only journals (operator)

Three changes landed in 5987081 and 06b4349. Read this before the next
scan step.

1. `core/screen.py prepare` now applies `strategy/screener-filters.json`
   before the strata fill. The file is yours to tune, same as
   screener-strata.json; it carries the title regexes for
   line-constructed and sub-daily crypto markets, the exact 0.500 mid
   drop, and a binary-outcome guard. On the 2026-09-03 scan it drops 343
   of 994 candidates, so the 300-market pool is now filled from the
   survivors. prepare's header reports every filter's count under
   `dropped_by_reason` as `filter:<name>` and a `filters` block with the
   file's blob hash. If you add a pattern, cite its footprint in the
   note the way the existing two do. screener-prompt.md stays frozen; its
   hard rule now runs in code as well, which is what gnhf run 3 decided.

2. `journal/screener-quota.json` is gone. The day's batches live under
   `journal/screener-quota/<runner>.json`, one file per runner (cloud or
   operator), and the 150 cap applies to the sum. prepare prints
   `day_batches_by_runner`. This closes the quota half of the
   collision-guard ask: two runners no longer race on one counter.

3. `.gitattributes` gives cycles.log, screener.jsonl, mech-requests.jsonl,
   watch-triggers.jsonl and funnel.jsonl a union merge, so an interleaved
   push from the other runner no longer conflicts on append-only files.
   ledger.jsonl, real-ledger.jsonl, forecasts.jsonl, schedule.json and
   the quota files still conflict on purpose; keep aborting those
   rebases as CYCLE.md step 9 says.

Still open from the collision-guard ask: a lease that stops two FULL
cycles researching the same hour. That needs the cloud routine's trigger
prompt as well as loop.sh, so it is a separate operator change. Until
then a duplicate paper bet stays a bounded cost under the $10 per-event
cap, as the deep retro judged.

Mark the collision-guard ask "actioned in part (quota, union merge);
lease open" on your next deep-retro status pass. Nothing else in your
procedure changes.

## 2026-09-04 ~22:15Z - screen.py collect summary-line crash fixed (operator)

e941cd8 unpacks the load_quota() tuple in cmd_collect. collect now exits
0 and prints the day total and the per-runner split on its summary line.
Mark the 2026-09-04 08:xxZ collect proposal "actioned (operator,
2026-09-04)" on your next deep-retro status pass. Nothing in your
procedure changes.

## 2026-09-04 ~23:20Z - gnhf run 4: mechanical counterfactual ledger landed; the outside-view veto stays (operator)

An overnight gnhf run built `core/counterfactual.py` (commit 3f2e6c9).
`python3 core/counterfactual.py ledger` replays every settled declined
forecast at flat $5 through replay.py's fill model and splits it by
skip_reason, side, category and sub-class with per-fold walk-forward
pnl and brier_delta against the market. `reconcile` diffs it against
your hand-kept counterfactual table in playbook.md. Nothing in your
procedure changes.

What it says about the outside-view veto, which is the gate you have
been questioning in retros:

- The table's apparent cost is one family. Five snapshots of the OpenAI
  Astra release markets are +34u of the +26u total. Without them the
  vetoed trades are 41W/50L and -7u, and the walk-forward folds lose
  their shape. That cluster sits entirely in the last fold, so a
  held-out total alone would still have read as a win.
- The vetoed beliefs are worse calibrated than the market they disagreed
  with (brier_delta +0.013 over the vetoed rows; +0.018 on today's
  ledger of 109 rows). The gate is skipping beliefs that lose.
- Verdict: keep the veto as it stands. Do not narrow it to a sub-class
  yet. countable-metric is the only sub-class whose beliefs beat the
  market, and it has 2 settled rows. Pre-registered trigger, mechanical:
  countable-metric reaches 5 settled rows with negative brier_delta and
  positive pnl on three of four held-out folds. Check it with
  `ledger --json` on deep-retro passes and quote the number.

What it says about the hand table: your arithmetic re-sums exactly, but
six rows are trades the protected caps would refuse (entries at 0.96 to
0.99, or no bid at record time), and nine rows measure edge against the
mid instead of the fill, always flattering, worst where the spread is
widest. From now on quote the mechanical ledger's totals in retros and
keep the hand table for the narrative; when the two disagree, the
ledger is the record. pnl in the tool is dollars; divide by 5 for units.

## 2026-09-06 ~00:30Z - countable-metric trigger amended to independent events; the bar is now mechanical (operator)

Your DEEP-2026-09-05 ask is accepted as written. The pre-registered
carve-out bar for a veto sub-class is now: 5 settled rows across at
least 3 independent gamma events, negative brier_delta, positive pnl,
and positive pnl on 3 of 4 held-out folds. Five snapshots of one GTA VI
market are one observation, as you said.

The bar is computed, not hand-checked, as of commit 2ac62b7:

- `python3 core/counterfactual.py ledger` prints an `evts` column on
  every group and a block headed "pre-registered carve-out bar" that
  says MET or not met with each condition's value beside its threshold.
  `--json` carries it under `bar`. Today it reads: rows 5, independent
  events 1, not met.
- Events come from journal/screener-events.jsonl, which
  `screen_replay.py events` now fills for forecast-ledger markets as
  well as screened ones. 326 of 531 forecast markets are mapped; an
  unmapped market counts as its own event, so `evts` can only overstate
  independence. Before quoting the bar on a deep-retro pass, run
  `python3 core/screen_replay.py events --limit 200` (about a minute,
  read-only against gamma) so the count is current.

Quote the bar block's line on each deep-retro status pass in place of
the hand-derived countable-metric line. The veto boundary stays where it
is until the block says MET. Mark the trigger-amendment ask actioned.

## 2026-09-06 ~00:45Z - runner lease is live; the collision-guard ask is closed (operator)

The 2026-09-04 00:40Z collision-guard ask is actioned in full as of this
commit. `core/lease.py` keeps a lease on origin (`refs/phil/lease`) that
says which runner is mid-cycle. CYCLE.md step 0 now reads it right after
the tip-based collision guard, and step 9 releases it after the push.
The quota race was already closed on 2026-09-04 (per-runner quota files).

What changes for you, cloud runner: at step 0 run
`python3 core/lease.py acquire`. If it prints `"acquired": false`, the
operator machine is mid-cycle; run a LIGHT tick. If true, proceed, and
run `python3 core/lease.py release` at the end of step 9, after the push
has been verified. TRIGGERED invocations skip both. On the operator
machine loop.sh does both and sets `PHIL_LEASE`, so when that variable
is present you run neither command.

The lease expires after 50 minutes on its own, so a run that dies
mid-cycle costs the other runner at most one LIGHT tick. If you ever see
`"reason": "unreachable"`, the lease failed open and the tip guard is
the only protection for that tick; note it in the cycle log line.

## 2026-09-06 ~07:40Z - lease regression fixed; cloud FULL cycles resume (operator)

Your 00:13Z diagnosis was exactly right and DEEP-2026-09-06's headline
was earned: the cloud credential can push branches but not the custom
ref, and `lease.py acquire` read that 403 as a lost race, so every cloud
cycle since 00:13Z ran LIGHT. Three FULL cycles were lost to it. Fixed in
the commit before this note, the third option the deep retro sketched:
a refused write now reports `"acquired": true, "written": false` with a
reason, and you proceed as a normal FULL cycle and mention it in the
cycle log line. A fresh lease held by the operator machine still demotes
you, so the lease protects the real-mode loop; it cannot protect the
cloud from the operator machine in the other direction, and the tip
guard still covers that.

Nothing else changes. Mark the 00:13Z lease-403 proposal actioned on
the next deep-retro pass.

## 2026-09-07 ~20:50Z - pre-register a relaxation fork for the outside-view veto (operator)

The veto stays. This note asks you to define, in advance, what evidence
would loosen it, so the decision is never made post hoc.

At your next deep retro, write a pre-registered fork into the playbook
for the outside-view-veto slice (judgment estimates with claimed edge
> 0.10), in the same shape as the DEEP-2026-08-17 mechanical-econ fork.
Proposed bar, read from `python3 core/counterfactual.py ledger` on the
`outside-view-veto` skip_reason group. Tighten it if the ledger argues
for that; do not loosen it:

1. dBrier negative (you ahead of the market) in two consecutive
   walk-forward folds.
2. Net realizable counterfactual P&L positive in those same folds.
3. At least 40 independent gamma events in the slice.

Check the bar at every deep retro and quote the tool's numbers. Hourly
cycles extend the table and do not act on the fork. If the bar is met,
propose a NARROW carve-out for the best-evidenced sub-class only
(candidate shape: No-side timeline theses of the "nothing announced"
kind, such as the Mythos rows), with band, floors, one trade per event,
and a kill switch armed in the same commit, per the mechanical-econ
template. If the bar is not met, the veto is untouched and the proposals
section carries one status line.

Why now. The slice reads 120 rows over 78 events, dBrier +0.027 behind
the market, counterfactual P&L +$115 concentrated in ai-model-release and
social-media-postcount and in the latest fold. Money made with worse
calibration is a fat tail until the sample says otherwise. The veto
gates money, not learning: every vetoed row is still forecast and graded,
so holding it costs nothing but foregone gains while the evidence
accumulates.

Mark this ask actioned once the fork is written.

## 2026-09-09 ~18:20Z - gnhf run 5: research-value prior tested; the escalation list stays (operator)

An overnight gnhf run asked whether your own forecast record says where
research beats the price, and whether that could re-rank the screened
pool. Landed in this commit: `core/screen_value.py` (dormant; `fit` prints
the prior, `rank` re-ranks a collect run without writing anything),
`core/screen_value_check.py` (the out-of-sample permutation test),
`strategy/screener-value.json` (a title-and-slug family mapper, yours to
tune), and the memo `journal/screener-value-decision.md`. Nothing in your
procedure changes.

What it says:

- Research is at par with the price it is handed: brier_delta +0.0080
  +/- 0.0091 over 542 settled rows and 394 events.
- A family prior ranks held-out rows WORSE than random: top-quartile lift
  +0.0196 at p 0.996 against 4,000 permutations. Price band and hours to
  resolution carry no spread at all. The family term changes sign between
  fitting windows.
- On the live pool the prior decides 0 of 15 slots; its list would be 15
  sports moneylines and would cut econ prints and politics, the two
  families whose counterfactual pnl held up out of sample.
- Research earlier in a market's life is worse, not better (z -2.36),
  mostly composition. The watch tier's 50 fires bought 32 forecasts and 4
  bets at -0.0167 +/- 0.0399: keep it, do not widen it.

What this means for you:

- The escalation list stays the divergence top 15. Do not build a family
  cap or a category tilt from the by-category tables in score.py or
  counterfactual.py; the memo shows why an in-sample family table does not
  survive a walk-forward test.
- `strategy/screener-value.json` is yours, but an edit there changes no
  live cycle. Do not run `screen_value.py rank` in a cycle; it is dormant.
- Any selection statistic you quote must average over ties
  (`screen_replay.top_k_weights`). A stable sort on a CONSTANT score faked
  a lift of -0.0069 here, the size of every real lift in the table.

Deep retro: add a one-line tracking entry per status pass for the switch
bar (settled rows and events from `fit`, slots decided from `rank`), the
way you track the screener evaluator. The bar is 1,000 rows and 700
events, a family lift negative at p <= 0.05 in 3 of 4 folds, and 8 of 15
slots decided. No proposal is open on it.

## 2026-09-09 ~21:00Z - forecast rows now carry book size at record time (operator)

`core/forecast.py record` writes two more fields on every new row:
`liquidity_at_record` and `volume_24h_at_record`, read from the same gamma
record the mid comes from (the fields scan.py already uses). They are
`null` when gamma omits them and are never filled in later. Nothing in
your procedure changes; the command takes no new flags.

Why: gnhf run 5 could not test whether research pays more on thin markets
than on deep ones, because 439 of 542 settled rows had no liquidity at
record time. In a month the ledger will be able to answer that. Do not
read the two fields into a rule until a retro has scored them across at
least two walk-forward folds; until then they are measurement only.

## 2026-09-09 ~21:45Z - mech second opinions have been blind by construction; send the market context once the tool allows it (operator)

Every one of your 37 delivered mech requests ran the market-aware tool
in blind mode (`market_prob_seen` null), because step 5a told you the
price could not be sent. That was true until 2026-09-07: Pearl Connect
merged a `request_context` argument for `mech_request`
(valory-xyz/connect#66). It is not in a release yet, so the build on
this machine may still lack it. Step 5a now says what to do in both
cases: read the tool schema once per cycle, and when `request_context`
is listed, send the market id, type, the Yes mid as a number, the
endDate and the resolution rules on every market-aware request, plus
the same object on the paired v4 request, which ignores it. Never put
your own estimate in it; on-chain it is public IPFS.

`core/mechlog.py record` takes `--context-p`, the market_prob you sent,
and writes it as `context_market_prob` (null when you sent none). Use it
on every mech log line from now on.

What this means for retros:

- Every mech comparison graded so far is blind versus blind versus you.
  Do not carry those numbers forward as a verdict on the market-aware
  tool; start a fresh paired count from the first delivery whose
  `market_prob_seen` is non-null.
- A market-aware delivery with `context_market_prob` set and
  `market_prob_seen` null is a supply-side bug, not a blind run. Name
  the request id in the cycle summary and the retro.
- The question the new rows answer is whether market-aware WITH the
  price beats the price it was shown. That is the number that decides
  if a mech second opinion earns a research slot. Nothing else in your
  procedure changes; the mech remains non-blocking.

## 2026-09-10 ~07:00Z - gnhf run 6: the econ lane is seen late because of the scan horizon; release calendar landed, dormant (operator)

An overnight gnhf run measured whether you see the markets in the two
families where your research beats the price, and when the price there
is still wrong. Landed in this commit: `journal/lane-coverage-decision.md`
(the memo) and `core/release_calendar.py` (dormant; `releases`, `match`
and `emit --lead` print scheduled agency releases, the open markets that
resolve on them, and watchlist calendar entries in the shape
core/watch.py reads, without writing anything). Nothing in your
procedure changes and nothing is switched on.

What it says:

- 400 of 609 econ-print markets listed in the last 28 days sat past the
  336-hour scan horizon for the whole window. The Economy tag returns
  96.7% of the lane, so the query is fine; the horizon is what hides
  them. No econ market was ever screened sooner than 376 hours after
  listing.
- The econ price converges AT the print, not before it: Brier against
  the outcome 0.181 at 7 days out, 0.165 at 1 day, 0.080 in the last 6
  hours. A 72-hour lead loses nothing to a 24-hour one.
- Your calendar tier has fired 7 times, produced 34 forecasts and 0
  bets, at brier_delta +0.0162 +/- 0.0219 over 33 rows. The problem it
  has is conversion, not attention.
- The politics lane already takes 122 of 1,800 escalation slots; its
  problem is crowding, and its family mixes election markets with
  say-this-word props.

What this means for you:

- Do not run `core/release_calendar.py` in a cycle and do not edit
  strategy/watchlist.json from its output; switching the emitter on is
  an operator act with a bet-based bar (memo, "The bar that would change
  this"). You will hear about it here first.
- When a calendar fire produces a forecast and no bet, say in the retro
  which gate stopped it. The tier's next 20 fires are graded on bets.
- Deep retro: track the memo's bar in one line per status pass, the way
  you track the other two switch bars.

## 2026-09-10 ~08:10Z - mech tool choice until the Pearl Connect release: v4 only (operator)

The `request_context` argument is not in any Pearl Connect release yet
and the server here is the Pearl-shipped binary, so it cannot arrive
before the next release. Until then a market-aware request is a blind
request, and a blind market-aware answer is a number nobody can grade.
Step 5a now picks the tool from the schema you read each cycle: while
`mech_request` lacks `request_context`, send `superforcaster-polymarket-v4`
only, one request per candidate, and no market-aware requests. The day
the schema lists it, the same paragraph flips you to market-aware with
the context plus the paired v4 request. Log v4 rows exactly as before;
the v4-only period still grades v4 against you and the market.

## 2026-09-14 ~13:30Z - mech evaluation restarts today; the question is the market-aware tool (operator)

Pearl Connect v0.1.4 shipped on 2026-09-10 08:18Z, ten minutes after the
note above, and it carries `request_context` (valory-xyz/connect#66).
Pearl still has to bump to it, so the build on the operator machine may
or may not list the argument yet. Nothing in step 5a changes: read the
`mech_request` schema once per cycle and let it pick the tool. What
changes is the bookkeeping and the question.

- **The mech request counter resets today.** Every row in
  `journal/mech-requests.jsonl` with `ts` before 2026-09-14 is history:
  61 requests, 38 deliveries, all of them blind. Do not carry any of
  their tallies, Brier comparisons, or contamination counts forward as
  evidence about the tools. Retros and deep retros grade mech rows with
  `ts >= 2026-09-14T00:00:00Z` only, and the deep retro's mech
  one-liner quotes that window's counts (deliveries, paired pairs,
  settled pairs) from zero.
- **The question is the market-aware tool.** The number that decides
  whether a mech second opinion earns a research slot is whether
  `superforcaster-market-aware`, shown the price through
  `request_context`, beats the price it was shown at settlement, and
  whether it beats you and the paired v4 request on the same prompt.
  Grade every settled pair on all three comparisons and keep a running
  line per deep retro: pairs settled, market-aware Brier, v4 Brier, own
  Brier, market Brier, and the count of deliveries whose
  `market_prob_seen` is null on a request that sent a context (supply
  bug, name the request id).
- **While the schema still lacks `request_context`**, the v4-only rule
  above stands, and the cycle summary says `mech context: unavailable
  (v4 only)` so the operator sees that Pearl has not bumped yet. The
  first cycle whose schema lists it says so in the cycle summary and
  the next deep retro opens the market-aware count.
- The prior contamination findings (Polymarket page in the sources,
  stale-year retrieval, supplied facts echoed back) stay in the playbook
  as reading rules for a delivery. They are not tallies; keep reading
  `source_content.serper_response.organic[]` dates and `market_prob_seen`
  on every delivery and name a recurrence in the retro when you see one.

Addendum 2026-09-14 ~14:40Z (operator): verified on the operator
machine. Pearl 1.9.8 pins Connect v0.1.4, both local Connect services
carry its hash, and the running pearl-connect MCP server lists
`request_context` on `mech_request` (probed via tools/list). So on
operator-machine cycles the schema read in step 5a flips you to
market-aware with the context plus the paired v4 request from the first
cycle that has the pearl-connect tools attached. The 13:24Z cycle today
ran without them (`PEARL_CONNECT_STORE` unset), which is an operator
setup gap, not yours; keep writing the one-line mech status in the
cycle summary so the gap is visible.

## 2026-09-21 ~14:00Z - settled_ts is now the market's close time; noticed_ts is when you saw it (operator)

Twice today (06:33Z, 12:26Z) the cloud routine and the operator loop
settled the same forecast in the same minute. The rows were identical
except for the wall-clock `settled_ts`, `journal/forecasts.jsonl` is
deliberately not union-merged, and the operator loop's rebase aborted
on that one field, so local main diverged and a human had to merge.

`core/resolve.py` now writes:

- `settled_ts` = the market's `closedTime` from gamma (fallback
  `umaEndDate`, then the wall clock). For a void row it is `end_date`
  plus the 48-hour grace. Two runners settling the same row now write
  byte-identical rows, which git merges cleanly.
- `noticed_ts` = the wall clock of the runner that flipped the row.

What this means for you:

- Settlement-duty timing in retros ("settled at X, graded at Y")
  uses `noticed_ts` from now on. `settled_ts` on rows settled before
  this note keeps its old meaning (when a runner noticed), so do not
  re-grade old lateness findings against the new field.
- `core/replay.py` and `core/screen_value.py` split train/test on
  `settled_ts`; the market close is the honest "outcome known" time
  for that purpose, so no change to their reading.
- Nothing else in your procedure changes.

## 2026-09-21 ~14:20Z - the mech step now evaluates Olas-Predict-R1-14B; write down what you see (operator)

Services 21, 44 and 25 each serve two new tools at the same 0.01 USDC:
`superforcaster-market-aware-olas-predict-r1-14b` (reads the price from
`request_context`) and `superforcaster_full_search_olas_predict_r1_14b`
(blind, full-page search). Both keep the superforcaster search pipeline
and prompt and swap the forecaster for Olas-Predict-R1-14B, a fine-tuned
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B on a self-hosted vLLM endpoint. The
operator launches the model publicly on 2026-09-22. CYCLE.md step 5a
("Which tool") now says what to send; this note says what to record.

- **Fresh count.** R1 evaluation starts with the first R1 delivery on
  or after 2026-09-21T14:00Z. The 2026-09-14 reset still bounds the
  GPT-4.1 market-aware count; quote the two windows separately.
- **Per delivery, in the forecast `--note` and the cycle summary's
  one "Mech:" line:** tool, service, `p_yes`, `confidence`,
  `market_prob_seen`, `p_independent`, `research_class`, latency, and
  whether the `<think>` block was stripped cleanly (a `parse_tier` other
  than `clause` or a null `p_yes` with its `null_reason` is a finding,
  not a failure). Say in one clause where R1 differed from GPT-4.1 on the
  same inputs and which one sat closer to your own estimate.
- **At settlement, in the retro:** the four-way line, R1 market-aware /
  R1 blind / GPT-4.1 market-aware (when paired) / own / market, each
  with its Brier against the outcome, and one sentence on why the
  winner won (better evidence, better calibration, or the price).
- **Deep retro, one running R1 block:** deliveries, failures by kind,
  median latency, settled pairs, cumulative Brier for R1 market-aware,
  R1 blind, GPT-4.1 market-aware, own and market on the same rows, and
  the two or three most instructive cases (a strong disagreement that
  settled, a contamination case, a case where R1's reasoning changed
  your estimate). Keep the prose concrete; the operator writes the
  launch story from this block and needs cases, not adjectives.
- **Honesty rules unchanged:** grade R1 as you grade everything else.
  A win for R1 is a win; a stale-year or price-leak contamination is a
  contamination regardless of which model produced it; small n is
  small n. The point is a fair record of a new tool's first week.

Correction 2026-09-21 ~14:30Z (operator): `noticed_ts` is gone again.
Its first hour proved the point of the note above the hard way: the
14:05Z operator cycle and the 14:16Z cloud tick settled the same
forecast, `settled_ts` matched exactly as designed, and the rows still
differed, on `noticed_ts` alone, so the operator loop's rebase aborted.
A per-runner wall clock on the row recreates the conflict the market
close time removes. Settlement-duty timing in retros uses the cycle log
instead: the tick whose line reports the settlement is the tick that
noticed it, and that line already carries the time. Rows written with a
`noticed_ts` between 13:48Z and 14:30Z today keep it; nothing reads it.

## 2026-09-21 ~21:25Z - R1 record: GPT-4.1 baseline on every R1 market, and a sample that settles this week (operator)

The first R1 day gave 10 deliveries on 5 markets. Two things limit what
the record can say by Friday 2026-09-25: only 2 of the 5 markets settle
this week, and 3 of the 5 have no GPT-4.1 row next to the R1 pair. This
note changes what to send. The 14:20Z note on what to record stands.

- **Baseline always.** Every market that gets the R1 pair also gets the
  third request, `superforcaster-market-aware` with the same context, on
  the same mech. This supersedes "at least one candidate per cycle" in
  CYCLE.md step 5a. Without the baseline on the same inputs, the
  four-way line at settlement has a hole and the row cannot compare R1
  with GPT-4.1.
- **Send order and the nonce.** Three requests per market, one at a
  time: R1 market-aware, R1 blind, GPT-4.1 market-aware. On the
  wire-nonce 401, retry once with a new `request_id` as before. Today's
  401 came on a sequential send, so keep logging each one with the gap
  to the previous delivery on that mech.
- **A sample that settles.** Each UTC day, send the full three-request
  set on at least 3 researchable markets that settle within 5 days,
  even when you skip the trade. Researchable means elections, rulings,
  launches, scheduled decisions and counts from a dated public record.
  Record the forecast as usual with its skip reason so it settles and
  gets graded. If the scan holds fewer than 3 such markets, say so in
  the cycle summary. Do not lower the research standard to fill the
  count: own estimate first, to a concrete number, as always.
- **Two groups in the R1 block.** Report researchable markets and
  price markets separately, each with its own counts and cumulative
  Brier lines. A price market is one decided by a live value the
  sources cannot hold (crypto touch and close, commodity close, index
  or share levels). The model's published evaluation excluded
  short-term asset prices, so the researchable group is the fair test
  and the price group is context. Keep sending the set on price markets
  you research anyway; do not seek them out for the R1 sample.
- **Tool changes.** The mech team may change the R1 tools' prompt or
  retrieval this week. If a delivery's shape or behaviour changes (a
  new field, more than 5 sources used, a different output example),
  note the first request id where you saw it, so the record can mark
  the break.
